    * Simulate a scenario
    *
    * Example URL: /scenario_simulators/:identity/actions/run
    *
    * @param  string        $identity The unique identifier of the simulator, used to initiate
 simulations. One of:
 <ul>
 <li>`creditor_verification_status_action_required`: Sets a
 creditor's `verification status` to `action required`,
 meaning that the creditor must provide further information
 to GoCardless in order to verify their account to receive
 payouts.</li>
 <li>`creditor_verification_status_in_review`: Sets a
 creditor's `verification status` to `in review`, meaning
 that the creditor has provided all of the information
 requested by GoCardless to verify their account, and is now
 awaiting review.</li>
 <li>`creditor_verification_status_successful`: Sets a
 creditor's `verification status` to `successful`, meaning
 that the creditor is fully verified and can receive
 payouts.</li>
 <li>`payment_confirmed`: Transitions a payment through to
 `confirmed`. It must start in the `pending_submission`
 state, and its mandate must be in the `activated` state
 (unless it is a payment for ACH, BECS, BECS_NZ or SEPA, in
 which cases the mandate may be `pending_submission`, since
 their mandates are submitted with their first
 payment).</li>
 <li>`payment_paid_out`: Transitions a payment through to
 `paid_out`, having been collected successfully and paid out
 to you. It must start in the `pending_submission` state,
 and its mandate must be in the `activated` state (unless it
 is a payment for ACH, BECS, BECS_NZ or SEPA, in which cases
 the mandate may be `pending_submission`, since their
 mandates are submitted with their first payment).</li>
 <li>`payment_failed`: Transitions a payment through to
 `failed`. It must start in the `pending_submission` state,
 and its mandate must be in the `activated` state (unless it
 is a payment for ACH, BECS, BECS_NZ or SEPA, in which cases
 the mandate may be `pending_submission`, since their
 mandates are submitted with their first payment).</li>
 <li>`payment_charged_back`: Behaves the same as the
 `payout_paid_out` simulator, except that the payment is
 transitioned to `charged_back` after it is paid out, having
 been charged back by the customer.</li>
 <li>`payment_chargeback_settled`: Behaves the same as the
 `payment_charged_back` simulator, except that the charged
 back payment is additionally included as a debit item in a
 payout, thereby settling the charged back payment.</li>
 <li>`payment_late_failure`: Transitions a payment through
 to `late_failure`, having been apparently collected
 successfully beforehand. It must start in the
 `pending_submission` state, and its mandate must be in the
 `activated` state (unless it is a payment for ACH, BECS,
 BECS_NZ or SEPA, in which cases the mandate may be
 `pending_submission`, since their mandates are submitted
 with their first payment). Not compatible with Autogiro
 mandates.</li>
 <li>`payment_late_failure_settled`: Behaves the same as the
 `payment_late_failure` simulator, except that the late
 failure is additionally included as a debit item in a
 payout, thereby settling the late failure.</li>
 <li>`payment_submitted`: Transitions a payment to
 `submitted`, without proceeding any further. It must start
 in the `pending_submission` state.</li>
 <li>`mandate_activated`: Transitions a mandate through to
 `activated`, having been submitted to the banks and set up
 successfully. It must start in the `pending_submission`
 state. Not compatible with ACH, BECS, BECS_NZ and SEPA
 mandates, which are submitted and activated with their
 first payment.</li>
 <li>`mandate_customer_approval_granted`: Transitions a
 mandate through to `pending_submission`, as if the customer
 approved the mandate creation. It must start in the
 `pending_customer_approval` state. Compatible only with
 Bacs and SEPA mandates, which support customer signatures
 on the mandate. All payments associated with the mandate
 will be transitioned to `pending_submission`. All
 subscriptions associated with the mandate will become
 `active`.</li>
 <li>`mandate_customer_approval_skipped`: Transitions a
 mandate through to `pending_submission`, as if the customer
 skipped the mandate approval during the mandate creation
 process. It must start in the `pending_customer_approval`
 state. Compatible only with Bacs and SEPA mandates, which
 support customer signatures on the mandate. All payments
 associated with the mandate will be transitioned to
 `pending_submission`. All subscriptions associated with the
 mandate will become `active`.</li>
 <li>`mandate_failed`: Transitions a mandate through to
 `failed`, having been submitted to the banks but found to
 be invalid (for example due to invalid bank details). It
 must start in the `pending_submission` or `submitted`
 states. Not compatible with SEPA mandates, which are
 submitted with their first payment.</li>
 <li>`mandate_expired`: Transitions a mandate through to
 `expired`, having been submitted to the banks, set up
 successfully and then expired because no collection
 attempts were made against it for longer than the scheme's
 dormancy period (13 months for Bacs, 3 years for SEPA, 15
 months for ACH, Betalingsservice, and BECS). It must start
 in the `pending_submission` state. Not compatible with
 Autogiro, BECS NZ, and PAD mandates, which do not
 expire.</li>
 <li>`mandate_transferred`: Transitions a mandate through to
 `transferred`, having been submitted to the banks, set up
 successfully and then moved to a new bank account due to
 the customer using the UK's Current Account Switching
 Service (CASS). It must start in the `pending_submission`
 state. Only compatible with Bacs mandates.</li>
 <li>`mandate_transferred_with_resubmission`: Transitions a
 mandate through `transferred` and resubmits it to the
 banks, can be caused be the UK's Current Account Switching
 Service (CASS) or when a customer contacts GoCardless to
 change their bank details. It must start in the
 `pending_submission` state. Only compatible with Bacs
 mandates.</li>
 <li>`mandate_suspended_by_payer`: Transitions a mandate to
 `suspended_by_payer`, as if payer has suspended the mandate
 after it has been setup successfully. It must start in the
 `activated` state. Only compatible with PAY_TO
 mandates.</li>
 <li>`refund_paid`: Transitions a refund to `paid`. It must
 start in either the `pending_submission` or `submitted`
 state.</li>
 <li>`refund_settled`: Transitions a refund to `paid`, if
 it's not already, then generates a payout that includes the
 refund, thereby settling the funds. It must start in one of
 `pending_submission`, `submitted` or `paid` states.</li>
 <li>`refund_bounced`: Transitions a refund to `bounced`. It
 must start in either the `pending_submission`, `submitted`,
 or `paid` state.</li>
 <li>`refund_returned`: Transitions a refund to
 `refund_returned`. The refund must start in
 `pending_submission`.</li>
 <li>`payout_bounced`: Transitions a payout to `bounced`. It
 must start in the `paid` state.</li>
 <li>`billing_request_fulfilled`: Authorises the billing
 request, and then fulfils it. The billing request must be
 in the `pending` state, with all actions completed except
 for `bank_authorisation`. Only billing requests with a
 `payment_request` are supported.</li>
 <li>`billing_request_fulfilled_and_payment_failed`:
 Authorises the billing request, fulfils it, and moves the
